# Wantyapps
## Hello!
Hello! My name is Uri Arev (aka. Wantyapps) and I am a software engineer.

I have created many projects (mostly unfinished ðŸ™ƒ) and I am working hard to create and publish more of them.

I try to make my projects high-quality and developer/user-friendly.

## Projects
* **[My site]**(https://github.com/wantyapps/SiteV2),  written in React, is one of my most-worked-on projects, featuring a user-friendly navigation bar, an about page, and an API (plus documentation).

* **[Wantyapp]**(https://github.com/wantyapps/wantyapp-ios), an iOS app I am working on that features an API request tool for my site.

* **[AMOSH]**(https://github.com/wantyapps/amosh), a birthday present (!) with cool features, games and easter eggs. 
And many more!
